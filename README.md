# Go-game
Felt like playing around with go and ebiten. Adding features as I see fit.

## TODO
- [ ] Add difficulty levels
  - [ ] Make Difficulty levels dynamic (i.e. chosen by player) by adding them to the main menu
- [ ] Add some improved graphics
- [ ] Make the players size increase with each piece of food eaten
- [ ] Fix movement
- [ ] Add high scores
- [ ] Improve collision detection - currently there's instances where it looks/"feels" like the player should be colliding with the food/mine but isn't
- [ ] Improve mine spawning by adding reverse clustering - i.e. made it the mines can't spawn within x range of another mine unless unable to
- [ ] Improve food placement, ensure not placed on screen borders
- [x] Replace hard coded images with ebiten text
